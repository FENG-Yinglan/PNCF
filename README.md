# Preference-based-Repository-Recommendation-on-Collaborative-Filtering-Neural-Network-model
Github, a social coding site, attracts thousands of software developers to join together for better collaboration. It currently hosts over three million projects maintained by over one million registered developers. In Github, users will select the projects they are interested in from these massive projects and become one of the contributions by coding. If repositories in Github can be recommended to suitable users early, the development of open source project can speed up. However, there is few study in the personalized repository recommendation in Github. In this paper, we present a general framework of PNCF, a preference-based neural collaborative filtering recommender model, and develop the instantiation of PNCF framework in Github repository recommendation with language preference called LR-PNCF. We use a neural network to capture the non-linear user-repository relationships and obtain abstract data representation from sparse vectors. Comprehensive experiments conducted on a real world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
This paper is in the course of contribution, so the code will be posted later
